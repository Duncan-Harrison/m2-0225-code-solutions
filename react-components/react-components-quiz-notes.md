## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a React component?
  React components are functions that take in data from an object and use that data to create reusable, fully functional UI elements for that portion of the website. Those UI elements would contain all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed for that functionality.
- How do you define a component in React?
  You define a component by declaring a function, assigning a name that starts with a capital letter to the function with an empty parameter (), then specifying the rules of the function (including a return statement) within the braces {}. You must also precede the function declaration with "export" or "export default" so the component can be exported from the file that hosts it. The rules of the function within the braces should return JSX or another imported component.
- How is a component "rendered" (made visible on the browser page)?
  Components are rendered through the JSX they return.
