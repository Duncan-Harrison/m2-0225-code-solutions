## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Briefly describe the Binary Search Tree data structure.
  The Binary Search Tree holds data in a tree, sorting the data into parent and child branches.
- What are some examples of when you would use a Binary Search Tree?
  Binary search trees are used when searching, inserting elements, and deleting elements need to be very efficient.
- How do you determine if an element is in a Binary Search Tree? What is its time complexity?
  Determining if an element is in the BST is done through a recursive search, which has Logarithmic complexity (O(Log n)).
- How do you add an element into a Binary Search Tree? What is its time complexity?
  You can add an element by inserting a new node to a branch that has one or fewer nodes already. That is a Logarithmic complexity function (O(Log n)).
- How do you remove an element from a Binary Search Tree? What is its time complexity?
  You can remove an element with the this.removeNode, which has Logarithmic complexity (O(Log n)).
