## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are modules?
  Modules are collections of code, each of which performs a specific task or function and is held in an external file.
- What is the difference between named and default imports?
  Default imports do not have to exactly match the name of the module in the exporting file. Named imports must exactly match the name used in the exporting file and must be contained within braces. Both types of imports, once imported, can be called within the importing file by the names used in the importing file.
- What is the difference between named and default exports?
  Default exports are unique to their files, as you can only have one per file, and they allow you to rename the exported module within the module that imports it. Named exports can only be imported if the importing file uses the exact name of the exported module, but you can have multiple named exports per file.
